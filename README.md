# belt of the wayfinder
This project is the design for a belt that uses vibrational motors to tell the wearer where north is.  This has been inspired by many similar projects in the past.  The basic concept is that by always knowing north, the wearer can gain an intuitive understanding of where north is and improve their sense of direction.

This project includes the PCB design, firmware, and mechanical assemblies.

CAD has been designed using Onshape and the link can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3174cd1b7d359cff45b60529/w/59155bcb796c6976c8cc7d48/e/c52ae8d364edc915756cc2c3)

As of this commit, the firmware and hardware have not yet been tested and development is still underway.
